## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Complete Lifecycle Architecture

### üîπ A. Pre-Seed / Founder Stage

**Initial Deployment Sequence:**
1.Admin contract is deployed
2. Admin contract deploys core infrastructure contracts (EquityToken, SoulboundNFT, Governance)
3. Admin contract mints initial equity tokens to founders
4. Admin contract mints Equity Certificate NFT to founders 
5. Admin contract deploys OptionPool contract with initial allocation (10-20% of total supply)
6. Admin contract establishes governance structure and admin roles
7. Admin contract configures transfer restrictions and compliance parameters

**Key Outcomes:**
- Founders hold majority equity with SoulboundNFT access
- Option pool reserved for future employees
- Governance framework established
- Transfer restrictions enforced

### üîπ B. Seed Funding via SAFEs and Convertible Notes

**SAFE Contract Implementation:**
- Investors deposit funds into SAFE contracts
- Investment terms recorded on-chain (cap, discount, valuation metrics)
- No immediate equity token minting (rights held in escrow)
- Automated conversion logic prepared for trigger events
- Investor information and rights stored immutably

**Convertible Note Contract Implementation:**
- Debt instruments accepting investor funds
- On-chain interest accrual using time-based calculations
- Conversion mechanics linking principal + interest to equity
- Maturity date tracking and early repayment options
- Integration with SAFE conversion events

**Compliance and Access:**
- Investors receive preliminary access credentials
- KYC/AML integration through whitelisting mechanisms
- SoulboundNFT preparation for future equity holders

### üîπ C. Equity Financing / Priced Rounds

**Series A/B Implementation:**
1. **Trigger Event Detection:** Qualified financing round initiation
2. **SAFE Conversion Process:**
   - Calculate conversion price (lower of cap or discount price)
   - Mint equity tokens based on conversion calculations
   - Automatically issue SoulboundNFTs to new equity holders
3. **Convertible Note Conversion:**
   - Calculate principal + accrued interest
   - Convert debt to equity at negotiated conversion rate
   - Issue equity tokens and SoulboundNFTs to note holders
4. **New Investor Onboarding:**
   - Direct equity token minting to Series A/B investors
   - SoulboundNFT issuance for transfer capability
   - CapTableManager updates for real-time ownership tracking
5. **Option Pool Adjustments:**
   - Increase option pool size if required by new investors
   - Mint additional tokens to OptionPool contract
   - Maintain governance control over employee incentives

### üîπ D. Employee Incentive Management

**Option Grant Lifecycle:**
1. **Grant Creation:** Deploy OptionGrant contracts for individual employees
2. **Vesting Schedule Setup:** Configure cliff periods, vesting duration, and acceleration triggers
3. **Token Claiming:** Employees claim vested tokens as schedules mature
4. **SoulboundNFT Issuance:** First-time equity recipients receive shareholder NFTs
5. **Departure Handling:** Unvested tokens return to OptionPool for recycling
6. **NFT Management:** Automatic burning of SoulboundNFTs when balances reach zero
