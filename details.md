## 2️⃣ Complete Lifecycle Architecture

### 🔹 A. Pre-Seed / Founder Stage

**Initial Deployment Sequence:**
1. Deploy core infrastructure contracts (EquityToken, SoulboundNFT, Governance)
2. Mint initial equity tokens to founders
3. Founders automatically receive SoulboundNFTs upon token receipt
4. Deploy OptionPool contract with initial allocation (10-20% of total supply)
5. Establish governance structure and admin roles
6. Configure transfer restrictions and compliance parameters

**Key Outcomes:**
- Founders hold majority equity with SoulboundNFT access
- Option pool reserved for future employees
- Governance framework established
- Transfer restrictions enforced

### 🔹 B. Seed Funding via SAFEs and Convertible Notes

**SAFE Contract Implementation:**
- Investors deposit funds into SAFE contracts
- Investment terms recorded on-chain (cap, discount, valuation metrics)
- No immediate equity token minting (rights held in escrow)
- Automated conversion logic prepared for trigger events
- Investor information and rights stored immutably

**Convertible Note Contract Implementation:**
- Debt instruments accepting investor funds
- On-chain interest accrual using time-based calculations
- Conversion mechanics linking principal + interest to equity
- Maturity date tracking and early repayment options
- Integration with SAFE conversion events

**Compliance and Access:**
- Investors receive preliminary access credentials
- KYC/AML integration through whitelisting mechanisms
- SoulboundNFT preparation for future equity holders

### 🔹 C. Equity Financing / Priced Rounds

**Series A/B Implementation:**
1. **Trigger Event Detection:** Qualified financing round initiation
2. **SAFE Conversion Process:**
   - Calculate conversion price (lower of cap or discount price)
   - Mint equity tokens based on conversion calculations
   - Automatically issue SoulboundNFTs to new equity holders
3. **Convertible Note Conversion:**
   - Calculate principal + accrued interest
   - Convert debt to equity at negotiated conversion rate
   - Issue equity tokens and SoulboundNFTs to note holders
4. **New Investor Onboarding:**
   - Direct equity token minting to Series A/B investors
   - SoulboundNFT issuance for transfer capability
   - CapTableManager updates for real-time ownership tracking
5. **Option Pool Adjustments:**
   - Increase option pool size if required by new investors
   - Mint additional tokens to OptionPool contract
   - Maintain governance control over employee incentives

### 🔹 D. Employee Incentive Management

**Option Grant Lifecycle:**
1. **Grant Creation:** Deploy OptionGrant contracts for individual employees
2. **Vesting Schedule Setup:** Configure cliff periods, vesting duration, and acceleration triggers
3. **Token Claiming:** Employees claim vested tokens as schedules mature
4. **SoulboundNFT Issuance:** First-time equity recipients receive shareholder NFTs
5. **Departure Handling:** Unvested tokens return to OptionPool for recycling
6. **NFT Management:** Automatic burning of SoulboundNFTs when balances reach zero
